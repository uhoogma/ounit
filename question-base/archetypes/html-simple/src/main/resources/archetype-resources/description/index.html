  Welcome to Ounit simple HTML question example.
</p>

<p>
  Your mission Jim, should you choose to accept it, is to
  write a HTML file that contains the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>An H1 heading "My Memories"</li>
  <li>A paragraph with the following contents: "Once upon a time ..."</li>
  <li>An unnumbered list with four elements:
      one, two, three, eat that</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Use internal CSS style sheet to apply the following effects:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heading text must use color <span style="color: #92B901">#92B901</span></li>
  <li>Heading text has to be centered</li>
</ul>

<p>
  NB! You have to be spot-on. Texts must precisely match the specification,
      no additional elements can be present.
</p>

<p>
  Good Luck!
</p>
