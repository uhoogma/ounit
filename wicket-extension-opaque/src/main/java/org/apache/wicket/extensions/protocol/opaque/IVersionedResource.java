/**
 * An OPAQUE specific Resource interface that can be used to bypass the default
 * file versioning scheme. Useful for dynamically generated resources that may
 * change somewhat but the changes should not invalidate the cache. An example
 * of such a resource would be a ZIP archive. If it is regenerated the archive
 * header may change but it will still contain exactly the same files.
 * Calculating an MD5 digest will result in a different checksum and another
 * resource will be sent to the LMS despite the fact that files inside the
 * archive have not changed at all. By using this interface you can use the
 * contents of the archive to calculate the checksum and thus avoid polluting
 * the LMS cache with multiple copies of essentially the same file. Please note
 * that the uniqueness of each resource is determined by the versioned file name
 * returned by this interface so make sure you generate names that do not
 * collide. Use with caution!
