 * API CLASS: This class is used in SOAP returns and should not be altered
 */
/**
 * OPAQUE Protocol compliant Question engine.
 *
 * This JSR-181 annotated interface contains all public methods of the OPAQUE
 * API.
 *
 * We are not using exactly the same WSDL as OpenMark does, mainly because:
 * <ol>
 * <li>RPC/encoded is deprecated and not supported by modern libraries</li>
 * <li>RPC/encoded is not WS-I compliant</li>
 * <li>We are targeting the Moodle OPAQUE plugin and PHP SOAP bindings NOT Om-s
 * own TestNavigator.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * By default Apache Axis2 and CXF use Document/literal wrapped pattern.
 * Unfortunately this requires manual (un-)wrapping in PHP. However, unwrapped
 * Document/literal is not WS-I compliant if method has multiple arguments. As a
 * result this interface operates in RPC/literal mode.

     * <p>
     * For security reasons, the URL may be https: and the test navigator (which
     * is likely to be the thing serving the URL) will operate an IP whitelist,
     * only responding to requests from question engines it has already
     * initiated connections to.
     * <h3>Initial parameters</h3>
     * initialParamNames and initialParamValues (which must be of equal length)
     * include initial configuration parameters to be passed to the question.
